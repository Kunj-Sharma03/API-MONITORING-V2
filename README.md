## 🎯 What Is This Thing?

Listen, we've all been there. You deploy your API, everything works perfectly on your machine (obviously), and then suddenly at 3 AM your users are flooding your inbox because your API decided to take an unscheduled vacation. **AP-EYE** is here to make sure you know about problems before your users do – because nobody likes angry customers, and nobody likes waking up to fire.

AP-EYE is a sleek, modern API monitoring application that watches your endpoints 24/7 and sends you beautiful PDF alerts via email when things go sideways. It's like having a very dedicated, never-sleeping intern whose only job is to ping your APIs and scream when they don't respond.

## 🌟 Features That'll Make You Go "Wow"

### 🔍 **Real-Time Monitoring**
- Monitor unlimited APIs (well, technically limited by your database, but who's counting?)
- Customizable check intervals (1-60 minutes, because checking every second is overkill)
- Smart failure detection with configurable thresholds
- Response time tracking because speed matters

### 📊 **Analytics Dashboard That Doesn't Suck**
- Beautiful charts that actually tell you useful information
- Uptime percentages that make you feel good (or bad) about your infrastructure
- Response time trends to spot performance issues before they become disasters
- Historical data because learning from the past is important

### 🚨 **Intelligent Alerting**
- Email notifications with gorgeous PDF reports (yes, we made PDFs pretty)
- 30-minute cooldown periods to prevent spam (your inbox will thank us)
- Detailed error messages that actually help you debug
- Modern, responsive design that works on all devices
- Dark theme by default because we're not monsters
- Smooth animations powered by GSAP
- Mobile-first design with a collapsible sidebar

### 🔐 **Security That Actually Works**
- JWT-based authentication
- Bcrypt password hashing (because plaintext passwords are so 2005)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- PostgreSQL with proper query sanitization

## ️ Tech Stack (The Good Stuff)

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15.3.4** - React framework that doesn't make you want to cry
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS that's actually useful
- **GSAP** - Animations so smooth they should be illegal
- **Chart.js** - Charts that look professional
- **ShadCN UI** - Components that don't need custom CSS to look good
- **SWR** - Data fetching that just works

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express** – REST API and app host
- **Apollo GraphQL (Apollo Server)** – Unified, efficient data layer at `/graphql`
- **Socket.IO** – Real‑time monitor updates and alerts
- **PostgreSQL** – Durable relational data store
- **JWT** – Auth tokens that don’t give you headaches
- **Nodemailer + Brevo** – Email that actually reaches inboxes
- **Railway** – Backend hosting that doesn’t break the bank

## 🧠 GraphQL API

- Endpoint: `POST /graphql`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`
- Playground: Enabled in development, disabled in production.

Example query (used by the dashboard):

```graphql
query GetDashboardData($timeRange: String!) {
	me { id email }
	monitors {
		id url status last_response_time last_status_code is_active interval_minutes
		stats { uptime_percentage avg_response_time last_24h_uptime }
	}
	analytics(range: $timeRange) {
		overview { total_monitors active_monitors overall_uptime avg_response_time }
		uptimeHistory(range: $timeRange) { date uptime_percentage }
		responseTimeHistory(range: $timeRange) { date avg_response_time }
		alertsHistory(range: $timeRange) { date alert_count }
	}
}
```

Example mutation:

```graphql
mutation CreateMonitor($input: CreateMonitorInput!) {
	createMonitor(input: $input) { id url is_active interval_minutes }
}
```

Variables example:

```json
{ "timeRange": "7d", "input": { "url": "https://api.example.com/health", "interval_minutes": 5, "alert_threshold": 3 } }
```

Tip: The frontend uses `src/hooks/useDashboardGraphQL.js` and `src/hooks/useGraphQL.js` to fetch this in one efficient query.

## ⚡ Real‑time with Socket.IO

- Client connects to `${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}` and joins a user room via `join-user-room`.
- Events emitted by the server:
	- `monitor-check` – Broadcast for each check result
	- `user-monitor-check` – User‑specific check result
	- `monitor-alert` – Broadcast when a monitor changes status
	- `user-alert` – User‑specific alert

Minimal client example:

```js
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';
const socket = io(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL);
socket.on('connect', () => socket.emit('join-user-room', userId));
socket.on('monitor-check', (data) => console.log('check', data));
socket.on('monitor-alert', (data) => console.log('alert', data));
```

See `frontend/src/hooks/useSocket.js` and `frontend/src/components/RealTimeDashboard.jsx` for a full integration.
## 🚀 Quick Start (For the Impatient)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (because living in the past is overrated)
- PostgreSQL database (local or hosted, we don't judge)
### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kunj-Sharma03/api-monitoring-app.git
cd api-monitoring-app

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Database Setup
```sql
-- Create your PostgreSQL database and run the schema
-- (Check out the backend/db.js file for the complete schema)
-- Or use our setup script if you're feeling lazy
```

### 3. Environment Variables (The Boring But Important Part)

**Backend (.env):**
```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-that-is-at-least-32-characters-long
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app

# Email Configuration (Brevo)
EMAIL_FROM=your-verified-email@domain.com
BREVO_SMTP_USER=your-brevo-smtp-user
BREVO_SMTP_PASS=your-brevo-smtp-password

# Monitoring
LOG_CLEANUP_DAYS=30
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app
```

**Frontend (.env.local):**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
```

## 📚 API Docs (Swagger)

- Swagger UI: `/api-docs`
- Swagger JSON: `/swagger.json`

Browse endpoints and try REST calls directly in the UI.

### 4. Deploy & Pray
```bash
# Deploy backend to Railway
# Deploy frontend to Vercel
# Watch the magic happen
```

## 📱 How to Use (It's Easier Than You Think)

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account (we promise not to spam you)
2. **Add Monitors**: Enter your API endpoints to monitor
3. **Configure Settings**: Set check intervals and alert thresholds
4. **Watch the Magic**: Get beautiful email alerts when things break
5. **Analyze Trends**: Use the analytics dashboard to spot patterns
6. **Sleep Better**: Knowing your APIs are being watched 24/7

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Backend (Railway)
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set environment variables
3. Deploy with automatic builds
4. Configure custom domain (optional but recommended)

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Lint, security audit, and build for both apps (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Optional advanced pipeline with Docker build/push and staged deploys (see `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`).
- The pipeline runs on pushes/PRs to main branches and performs a healthcheck against `/health`.

### Frontend (Vercel)
1. Import project from GitHub
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable
3. Deploy with zero configuration
4. Enjoy automatic deployments on every push

### Database (Railway PostgreSQL)
1. Add PostgreSQL addon to your Railway project
2. Copy connection URL to your environment variables
3. Run database migrations (or let the app create tables automatically)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"CORS Error"**
- Solution: Update `CORS_ORIGIN` in backend environment variables

**"Email not sending"**
- Solution: Double-check your email provider credentials and quotas

**"Database connection failed"**
- Solution: Verify your `DATABASE_URL` format and network access

**"PDF generation failing"**
- Solution: Check file permissions and temp directory access

**"Charts not loading"**
- Solution: Clear browser cache and check console for JavaScript errors
